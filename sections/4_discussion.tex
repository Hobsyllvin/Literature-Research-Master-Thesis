    % Critique on framework: does not separate abstract from real tasks that are trained in the VE
    % Limitations of systematic review itself
    % Implications for future studies, mention practical implications

Haptic feedback has been found to hinder motor learning especially for tasks that naturally did not involve haptic feedback and when it was provided in a rather abstract way. Hanashima et al. for example provided vibrotactile feedback for posture learning and found the visual only condition to be superior over the visuo-tactile condition \cite{Hanashima2023}. Hovewer, when we learn a posture from another person in real life, we will also either depend on visual feedback only (for example when imitating the other person and using a mirror), or we will have actual guidance (for example from a physiotherapeut). Vibrational feedback however does not seem to be a meaningful way to provide haptic feedback when learning postures.

Suggestions: For the post hoc evaluation of the haptic feedback fidelity, it would be helpful if researchers included specifications of the device used, such as hard- and software latency, maximum force, sensor and actuator accuracy, etc., even if the device is commercially available. This makes the objective rating of the feedback fidelity easier and quicker, as even for commercially used devices the specifications might not be available anymore at some point in the future.

Often, an artificial task is chosen, such as tracking a trajectory with a steering wheel, where the velocity of the car is constant to eliminate the use of foot pedals \cite{LeeH2014}. For the retention, the subjects are using the exact same setup, so parameters such as the degrees of freedom, and the stimuli of experiment and retention are the same, thus increasing the level of fidelity. However, the performance of the participants driving a real car, or even driving in a more realistic simulator is never evaluated, despite this actually being an interesting question. In the end, we want to know how we can effectively improve motor learning performance by providing haptic feedback to the user. If we are doing this only for artificial tasks, we are making the experimental setup easier and possibly cheaper, but not exploring the greater possibilities this technology might offer. 

One important finding is that haptic feedback might be especially important when learning a motor task that requires 3 dimensions. Studies that required the participants to follow a trajectory in 2D have often found no significant improvement in task performance when providing haptic feedback, compared to visual feedback only (\cite{Gambaro2014}, \cite{LiuG2014}, \cite{LeeH2014}), whereas studies involving trajectory following in 3 dimensions have shown a significant improvement with the introduction of haptic feedback (\cite{Grant2019}, \cite{Rodriguez2010}, ...)
