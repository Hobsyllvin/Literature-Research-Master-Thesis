\section{Discussion}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Summarize key findings of section results (\ref{sec:results}) in one or two paragraphs
    \item Interpretation of the results, discussion of the meaning in the context of motor learning
    \item Justify interpretation by citing the supporting key studies
    \item Discuss possible alternative interpretations of the data (if applicable)
    \item Mention limitations of my research 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Critique on framework: does not separate abstract from real tasks that are trained in the VE
        \item Limitations of systematic review itself
    \end{itemize}
    \item Implications for future studies, mention practical implications
\end{itemize}

Suggestions: For the post hoc evaluation of the haptic feedback fidelity, it would be helpful if researchers included specifications of the device used, such as hard- and software latency, maximum force, sensor and actuator accuracy, etc., even if the device is commercially available. This makes the objective rating of the feedback fidelity easier and quicker, as even for commercially used devices the specifications might not be available anymore at some point in the future.

Often, an artificial task is chosen, such as tracking a trajectory with a steering wheel, where the velocity of the car is constant to eliminate the use of foot pedals \cite{LeeH2014}. For the retention, the subjects are using the exact same setup, so parameters such as the degrees of freedom, and the stimuli of experiment and retention are the same, thus increasing the level of fidelity. However, the performance of the participants driving a real car, or even driving in a more realistic simulator is never evaluated, despite this actually being an interesting question. In the end, we want to know how we can effectively improve motor learning performance by providing haptic feedback to the user. If we are doing this only for artificial tasks, we are making the experimental setup easier and possibly cheaper, but not exploring the greater possibilities this technology might offer. 

One important finding is that haptic feedback might be especially important when learning a motor task that requires 3 dimensions. Studies that required the participants to follow a trajectory in 2D have often found no significant improvement in task performance when providing haptic feedback, compared to visual feedback only (\cite{Gambaro2014}, \cite{LiuG2014}, \cite{LeeH2014}), whereas studies involving trajectory following in 3 dimensions have shown a significant improvement with the introduction of haptic feedback (\cite{Grant2019}, \cite{Rodriguez2010}, ...)
