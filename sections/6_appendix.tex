\footnotemark[1]Body Location (The degree to which the same location(s) on the body or body parts of the user are involved) \\
\footnotemark[2]Body Area (The degree to which the same extent of the body surface of the user is involved) \\
\footnotemark[3]Stimuli (the degree to which the same haptic receptors fo the user are involved) \\
\footnotemark[4]Magnitude (the degree to which the same intensity (e.g. force) and variation (e.g. texture) of stimuli are involved) \\
\footnotemark[5]Sensor integrity (the degree to which haptic stimuli and stimuli of other modalities match regarding the intent of the system) \\
\footnotemark[6]Degrees of freedom \\
\footnotemark[7]Hardware precision (the extent to which the hardware of the system can reproduce the detail of haptic feedback compared to the natural feedback) \\
\footnotemark[8]Software precision (the extent to which the system can calculate the detail of haptic feedback) \\
\footnotemark[9]Dependency \\
\footnotemark[10]Distinguishability \\
\footnotemark[11]Hardware latency \\
\footnotemark[12]Side Effects \\
\footnotemark[13]Constraints \\
\footnotemark[14]Software latency \\
\footnotemark[15]Addressed body parts that are different from the ones addressed in the natural occurrence of the task\\
\footnotemark[16]Addressed body parts in the natural occurrence of the task\\
\footnotemark[17]Degrees of freedom in VR\\
\footnotemark[18]Degrees of freedom in the natural occurrence of task\\
\footnotemark[19]See equation \ref{eq:diff}\\
\footnotemark[20]1kHz system, 240Hz screen \\
\footnotemark[21]Simulation not precise enough \\
\footnotemark[22]Serial connection with high speeds \\
\footnotemark[23]A bit less than the first condition, as it is not the slider itself, but a robotic arm with less movement speed (300mm/s) \\
\footnotemark[24]Intensity with 9N force is not quite matched \\
\footnotemark[25]400 dpi \\
\footnotemark[26]No weight nor vibration on the drill \\
\footnotemark[27]500 Hz frequency sufficient for this task \\
\footnotemark[28]Potentiometer for measuring ball position, an optical encoder with 3600 lines per revolution \\
\footnotemark[29]Frequency 1 kHz \\
\footnotemark[30]Optical quadrature encoder (2048 counts per revolution)	 \\
\footnotemark[31]Entire palm, ring- and little finger left out \\
\footnotemark[32]Texture is not matched but mimicked \\
\footnotemark[33]Mean errors 0.597mm in height, 3.74deg in roll, 0.919deg in pitch sufficient \\
\footnotemark[34]120 Hz refresh rate likely to be too little \\
\footnotemark[35]Texture is not matched, and intensity through vibration only to some extent \\
\footnotemark[36]Sensing error only about 1 degree \\
\footnotemark[37]Only one vibration for each finger cannot mimic distinguishable sensations when grasping the objects \\
\footnotemark[38]HMD with 640 x 480 pixels not very high  in resolution \\
\footnotemark[39]Body area way larger than in reality (palm vs. fingertip) \\
\footnotemark[40]Only vibration, no skin stretch possible when sliding on the test surface for example \\
\footnotemark[41]Noise in tracking head motion \\
\footnotemark[42]Tracking error of 3-5 degrees \\
\footnotemark[43]9 N force sufficient for trajectory, but not sufficient for the force that can be exerted by the user \\
\footnotemark[44]3 kHz refresh rate, 4k LED screen 60 Hz \\
\footnotemark[45]Difficult to quantify, but since the torso is the main part where a human would be affected by currents, we give this a medium-high score \\
\footnotemark[46]Difficult to quantify (human is not a submarine). But since the entire torso is covered with the haptic suit, we give this a medium-high score \\
\footnotemark[47]Only vibrational feedback provided  \\
\footnotemark[48]Cannot quite match the magnitude with vibrotactile feedback only \\
\footnotemark[49]VR DoF times 1.5, to get for DoF to a medium-high score. Medium score, since all the mechanoreceptors on the human torso, cannot be covered with 20 vibrators on the front and back, but they will imitate a solid impression of different mimicked sensations \\
\footnotemark[50]Good distinguishability due to sheer amount of vibrators, however only vibrations for each sensation \\
\footnotemark[51]Dedicated graphics card, and commercial controller should suffice for required precision \\
\footnotemark[52]Drill was not turning, thus no rotational inertia \\
