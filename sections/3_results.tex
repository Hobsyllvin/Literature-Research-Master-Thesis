\section{\struct{Results}}
Figure \ref{fig:fidelity_plot} displays the haptic feedback fidelity and versatility scores of the systems described in each article. The quality score of each system is depicted by the dot's color and size, respectively.

\subsection{\struct{KMeans clustering}}

In order to structure the data, we clustered the evaluated systems using the KMeans algorithm. The optimal number of clusters was calculated based on the silhouette score \cite{Rousseeuw1987Silhouettes:Analysis} (see figure \ref{fig:silhouette}.

\end{figure}

As can be seen in figure \ref{fig:kmeans}, the data was separated in 9 different clusters. Each cluster center is depicted by a small blue dot.

\subsection{\struct{Evaluation of the clusters}}
Cluster I unites studies that have a relatively low haptic fidelity score, however they have a fairly high versatility. This is because ..., in the papers haptic feedback had this effect, ...

Cluster IV and V concern studies with ...
